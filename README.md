# Triangle Track

This project presents:

Types of Triangle

## Description of Project and BDD

```
  1. How the Project works
  -------------------------
  This Project describes the type of triangle according to the sides measurement the user inputs.

  First the software has to test if input sides form a triangle, if true then it will executes conditions by prooving if the triangle is Equilateral,isosceles or scalene. 

  If input sides don't form a triangle, the software will return a message telling that Input Sides don't form a triangle. 

  2. Triangle and Triangle types conditions Description (BDD)
  ------------------------------------------------------
  | Behaviour                                                                                                                      | input | output                |
  |--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|-----------------------|
  |Let's suppose 3 respectives sides a,b,c of a triangle:
   If a+b>c=true and a+c>b=true and b+c>a=true, then input sides form a triangle   |

  | If all the sides are equal the triangle is an  equilateral triangle                                                                         | 8,8,8 | equilateral           |
  | If any two sides are equal the triangle is an isosceles triangle                                                                         | 5,3,5 | isosceles              |
  | If all the side are not equal and the sum of any two side of the triangle is greater than the third side, the triangle is a scalene triangle | 8,9,7 | scalene               |

  | if the sum of any two sides of  the triangle is equal or less  than the third remaining side, then it is not a triangle        | 9,4,3 | Not a triangle |
